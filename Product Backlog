Sprint 1 - Set up infra and basic flow - 3-Apr to 9-Apr


As a client I want to tip without providing my contact info, so I do not need to maintain personal relationship with all waiters.
	Given I am a client
	when I open app
	than I can choose the amount to tip.

	Given I choose the amount to tip
	when I identify the waiter
	than the amount selected flows to the waiter.

As a waiter I want to receive my tip personally, so I do not need to interact with the owner of the store/restaurant/bar.
	Given I am a waiter
	when I open app
	than I see the total amount available.

	Given that a client wants to tip me
	when he/she selects me
	than I see the amount tiped.

As a waiter I want to know how much I got, so I can decide when is enough for the day.

As a client I want to choose the ammount to tip, so I can evaluate the service and tip as appropriate.

As a waiter I want to withdraw the cash I got in a secury way, so I can use the money.

As a waiter I want to send the cash I got to my bank account, so I can use the money as part of the salary.

As a client I want to use my credit card to tip, so I feel safier.

As a client I want to be recognized with minimun or none action so I can tip quickly.
